ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Zhaohan and I'm currently based in London. I'm born and raised in Beijing, and spent my college years in NYC.

- Huge believer in the blurred line between art and tech. STEM kid in high school and studied cinematography at NYU.
- Thinking about how to translate human insights and perceptions into automated systems.
